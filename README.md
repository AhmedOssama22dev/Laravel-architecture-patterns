# Laravel Architecture Patterns

This repository is a collection of different software architecture patterns implemented in **Laravel**. The goal is to demonstrate how various architecture styles (such as Clean Architecture, Hexagonal Architecture, Onion Architecture, and more) can be applied to a Laravel application. This will help developers understand the practical application of each architecture and provide a starting point for building robust, maintainable, and scalable Laravel applications.

By exploring this project, you'll gain insight into how these architectures differ, how they can be implemented in Laravel, and how they can be used in different use cases. Whether you're new to these patterns or looking to deepen your knowledge, this repository will serve as a valuable resource.

## Branches

Each branch in this repository represents a different architecture pattern. The code in each branch is tailored to demonstrate the core principles and structure of that pattern in a Laravel context.

- **`clean-architecture`**: Clean Architecture implementation in Laravel. This pattern emphasizes separation of concerns and the independence of business logic from frameworks, UI, and databases.
  
- **`hexagonal-architecture`**: Hexagonal Architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters) implemented in Laravel. This approach isolates the core business logic from external systems like databases, APIs, and user interfaces.
  
- **`onion-architecture`**: Onion Architecture applied to Laravel. This architecture focuses on building the application around the core business logic, surrounded by layers that interact with external dependencies.

- **`mvc`**: Traditional Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern using Laravel's built-in features. This branch shows how the Laravel framework follows the MVC paradigm for web development.
